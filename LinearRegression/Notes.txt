-ask a question
	-does increased time on ice lead to more goals?
-pre-process data
	-group by player_id, x is timeOnIce per 60, y is goals per 60
-tune hyperparameters
-run model
	-player_id
-check assumptions
-interpret results in plain English
	-need to control for position as covariate and re-run analysis
	-could also do a cluster analysis (instead of looking up player position), which is stupid but good practice
