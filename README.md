# Hockey

Welcome to my hockey repo. This is where I practice model building using NHL data I sourced from Kaggle. I chose NHL data for this project because it keeps me interested (which leads to more model building) and because my domain knowledge in hockey helps me build better models.

There are separate directories for each model I've built. Within each directory you'll find a Jupyter notebook with the code used to wrangle the data and run the model of choice. I've been vigilant with commenting, so the notebooks should be easy to follow.
